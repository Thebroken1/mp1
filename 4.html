                    Of the female labor force in India, more than 94 percent of workers make their living in 
                    the unorganized sector. Yet this demographic largely remains invisible due to the 
                    self-employed nature of their work. Since these women are not part of the mainstream 
                    salaried workforce, they do not have access to welfare benefits that laborers in the 
                    traditional workforce do, leaving them unprotected.<br></br>

                    Incorporated in 1972, the <a href="http://www.sewa.org/index.asp">Self-Employed Women’s Association</a>, or SEWA, is a trade union 
                    made up of poor and self-employed female workers that earn a living through self-run 
                    small businesses or their personal labor. SEWA aims to organize women so that they can 
                    attain full employment and all its benefits including social security, which is defined 
                    as health care, child care and shelter. SEWA stimulates full employment and female 
                    self-reliance by offering a number of services including health care, child care, 
                    banking through the Sewa Bank (a cooperative bank with credit and finance services), 
                    insurance via VimoSEWA (SEWA insurance), legal services and housing.

                    Snehalaya translates to “home of love” and is an NGO that was founded in 1989 in the 
                    Indian city of Ahmednagar. The NGO provides support to women, children and LGBT 
                    communities. Snehalaya specifically focuses on these <a href="https://www.snehalaya.org/">
                        vulnerable members of society</a> 
                    that have suffered at the hands of HIV and AIDS, trafficking, sexual violence and 
                    poverty.<br></br>
                    Snehalaya has made great strides in raising awareness for these disadvantaged 
                    communities and continues to offer safe havens and escapes to women and children 
                    imprisoned in the cycle of poverty and abuse. Currently, the organization reaches more 
                    than 19,000 beneficiaries a year by offering services including:<br></br>

                        government policies that promote women’s rights and increase female representation

                        The <a href="http://azadfoundation.com/">Azad Foundation</a> is a professional feminist organization founded in 2008 that 
                        specifically works with resource-poor women living in urban areas in India. The 
                        Foundation provides opportunities for disadvantaged women to earn a livelihood as 
                        professional drivers and has trained hundreds of women since inception. The 
                        Foundation also trained and then employed the first ever female bus driver in 
                        Delhi.<br></br>
                        In total, the Azad Foundation has trained more than 1,800 women in a range of 
                        topics to including self-defense, sexual and reproductive health, basic first aid 
                        as well as map reading.<br></br>
                        The organization, which was founded in Delhi, has now expanded and has training 
                        centers in Jaipur and Kolkata. By offering training to women so that they can become 
                        professional drivers to earn a decent living, the Azad Foundation bolsters the 
                        economic status of underprivileged women while offering them the independence of 
                        self-reliance.<br></br>

                        operates in 24 states in India. Even though women make up about 60 to 70 percent 
                        of the farming workforce in India, they only account for around 12 percent of 
                        landholdings. Since female farmers rarely own the land they work on, they are 
                        excluded from important support services provided by the government. However, 
                        MAKAAM seeks to empower female farmers by teaching them to assert their rights 
                        and gain ownership of their livelihoods and the natural resources that come with it.
